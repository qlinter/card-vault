# Card Vault

[简体中文](./README.md) | English

Card Vault is a local-first Windows sports-card collection application built with Next.js, React, Prisma, SQLite and Electron. Archives, images and financial history stay on the computer; AI and share hosting are optional external services.

## Current status

Source version: `1.3.3` (2026-09-11), combining DeepSeek support, UI improvements and architecture cleanup. Scope and validation are recorded in the [v1.3.3 release notes](./docs/release-v1.3.3.md).

Following user confirmation, unsigned Windows x64 artifacts were generated on 2026-09-11: `dist/card-vault-1.3.3-setup.exe`, `dist/card-vault-1.3.3-portable.zip` and `dist/SHA256SUMS.txt`. Full release checks, packaged business flows, version, bundle contents and SHA-256 verification passed. Earlier distribution facts remain in their historical release notes.

## Latest version: v1.3.3

1. **DeepSeek**: dedicated settings default to the official `deepseek-flash` model, with native image input, connection testing, model discovery and Windows encrypted credential storage.
2. **Financial layouts**: align history amounts and edit actions; use consistent label/value columns for holdings and keep edit buttons stable when forms expand.
3. **Portfolio and filters**: shorten cost/valuation sorting and section names; fix concentration alignment, long product names and sales-review dates, and remove duplicate wording and excess space.
4. **Shared AI configuration**: Electron, server and UI reuse defaults, types, public settings and draft merging. Omitted keys remain saved, explicit empty keys clear credentials, and custom profiles merge by ID.
5. **Architecture**: remove six obsolete financial actions, separate gallery HTML, CSS and browser scripts, and eliminate two type-dependency cycles while retaining the rendering interface and generated output.
6. **Maintenance gates**: add dependency-cycle and client/server boundary checks to release validation, with credential-compatibility and financial/Portfolio UI regressions.

Database structure, accounting rules and backup formats remain unchanged. DeepSeek settings are compatible with existing version-5 configuration files; live recognition quality requires the user's own key. Source and packaged-runtime validation are complete for this version; real Windows installation and upgrade tests remain deferred.

## Features

- Home: search, filters, global financial ordering, paginated loading and remembered Cards/List views.
- Cards: up to five images, rotation, drafts, continuous entry, templates, duplicate hints, batch image preparation and AI candidates requiring review.
- Finance: one physical quantity, mixed CNY/USD payments, moving-average cost, transaction/expense/valuation history, manual FX and explicit incomplete-data states.
- Showcase and Portfolio: collection browsing, structure and historical trends, quality queues, saved views, frozen snapshots and comparison.
- Shares: editable galleries, themes, sections and stories, shared preview/export rendering, static packages and the existing manual Drop workflow.
- Plans: 180-day maintenance reminders, 7/30-day digests, wishlists and separate currency budgets.
- Settings: Data, AI, Finance, User guide and About. Expand Data to manage Storage, Backup & restore, Import and Export.
- Data: CSV/XLSX mapping and preview, archive updates, per-row retries and conflict-safe undo. Full backups include the database, media and management state.

There is no independent mobile app. Narrow viewports such as 390px validate shared web galleries for phone browsers. Managed online publishing, multi-device sync and system digest notifications are outside the current scope.

## Local development

Use Node.js 24 and the locked dependencies:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run db:init
npm run build
npm run electron
```

Alternatively, start the desktop development app with `start-desktop.bat`. The launcher prefers ports 3000–3019 and falls back to an OS-assigned loopback port when that range is occupied or reserved by Windows; system port exclusions need no changes. Development configuration uses `%APPDATA%\Card Vault Development`. The actual collection directory is shown under Settings → Data → Storage. Use the application migration controls to change it.

API keys reside in the local user configuration and are encrypted with Windows safeStorage, not stored in the collection database. Optional AI supports Azure OpenAI, MiniMax, DeepSeek and OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible services. Relevant images or content are sent to the selected provider only when a feature is called. Manual entry does not require AI.

## Validation and distribution

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run check:release` | Encoding, docs, metadata, architecture, lint, types, coverage, production build, desktop startup and all HTTP/UI checks; does not package. |
| `npm run check:architecture` | Check source cycles and client imports of Node.js/database modules. |
| `npm test` | Unit and module tests. |
| `npm run test:card` / `test:share` / `test:security` / `test:management` / `test:export` | Business and security HTTP flows using isolated data. |
| `npm run test:ui` | Desktop UI, minimum-window checks, narrow share previews and strict screenshot comparisons. |
| `npm run test:desktop` | Real-server startup with port contention, session checks and service restart. |
| `npm run benchmark` | Isolated 1k/5k/10k synthetic collection benchmarks. |
| `npm run benchmark:portfolio-history` | Compare complete monthly output and timings with the frozen former implementation. |
| `npm run benchmark:export` | Validate streamed exports for 1k/10k cards, including duration and server memory. |
| `npm run benchmark:dense` | Dense financial history and synthetic-image benchmarks at 1k/5k/10k cards. |
| `npm run audit:all` / `audit:prod` | Online audit of all dependencies or production dependencies only; CI audits all dependencies, including packaging tools. |
| `npm run release:win` | After confirmation: full checks, installer, portable ZIP, packaged smoke tests and SHA-256. |
| `npm run verify:release-artifacts` | Verify existing artifacts, version, structure, signing mode and checksums. |

The installer provides a directory-selection wizard. Extract the entire portable ZIP before running `Card Vault.exe`; the executable depends on its adjacent runtime files. End users do not need Node.js. See [Windows signing](./docs/windows-code-signing.md) for release configuration.

Keep a full backup before upgrades or moving computers. CSV/XLSX files omit media and application state and cannot replace backups. Only the complete current database format is supported. Restore requires a valid backup manifest and does not upgrade older data; see the [backup guide](./docs/data-backup-guide.md).

## Historical releases

All 27 earlier versions are retained below, newest first. These summaries describe each release at the time; current behavior and compatibility follow the latest documentation. The original bilingual summaries were recovered from the v1.2.1 README files, with v1.3.0, v1.3.1 and v1.3.2 added from their release notes. Early standalone release notes were not found; see [historical sources and gaps](./docs/version-history-sources.md).

## Documentation

- [Historical sources and gaps](./docs/version-history-sources.md): recovered README history and documentation policy.
- [Documentation index](./docs/README.md): current specifications and release history.
- [v1.3.3 release notes](./docs/release-v1.3.3.md): DeepSeek, UI changes, architecture cleanup, validation and distribution status.
- [Product roadmap](./docs/product-roadmap.en.md); [中文](./docs/product-roadmap.md).

Application source lives in `app`, `components`, `lib` and `electron`. `scripts` handles preparation, tests and distribution; `tests` contains regressions and visual baselines. Git ignores personal data, secrets, `node_modules`, `.next`, `logs`, `dist` and test runtime files. Both READMEs retain detailed notes for the latest version and concise entries for every earlier version. Full release notes and source provenance remain in `docs`; a new release must not remove older entries.
